## About Me

Hey there, I am Harshit Seksaria. I am currently a sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati, pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering. I am an open-source enthusiast with a keen interest in development, specifically mobile development and sports programming.

I have always looked at the skill of development in a way that could create value for folk and drastically reduce manual work. This becomes evident in the projects I have worked on - (i) a portal for my college peers, to benchmark their academic performance and for self-assessment, which received more than 600 registrations, (ii) a discord bot for a competitive open-source event - Codepeak, which crawls the GitHub website to identify merged PRs and award points to the participants in a google spreadsheet. The impact of this bot was that it nullified the amount of manual work for mentors to maintain the spreadsheet after every contribution.


## Skills



* Well versed in Android Development - **Kotlin**, **Flutter**, and **Dart**.
* Fluent in the following backends - **Firebase**, **Django**, and **Appwrite**.
* Experienced with using **APIs**.
* Proficient in version control with **Git** & **GitHub** including actions/workflows.
* Experienced with **Python** for various domains like web scraping, automation, etc.
* Decent working experience in **Figma**.
* Proficient in Database Management using **SQL**.
* Proficient in **C** / **C++**.


## Open Source History

Being an open-source enthusiast, I have been following it, making regular contributions, and participating in various open-source events for a long time now. Following is the list of open-source events I have been a part of.


* **Google Code In 2018** - Participated and contributed to different projects, and successfully completed **4 tasks** during the event.
* **Codepeak 2021 (Participant)** - Codepeak is an annual month-long open source competition co-organized by IIT Guwahati and IIT Patna. Ranked **2nd** among 2500+ participants.
* **Hacktoberfest 2022** - Got **8 PRs merged** in projects tagged with hacktoberfest during the month-long event.
* **Codepeak 2022 (Mentor)** - Mentored for a project in the event.


## Statement of Motivation


### What is your motivation for participating in Google Summer of Code?

I have always been intrigued by how open source can turn an idea into a working entity that is used by hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. I myself have grown up consuming different open-source softwares. Even as a developer, a significant portion of the tech stacks I use consists of open source services. I firmly believe that open source is not getting the recognition it deserves. By participating in GSoC, I want to further hone my understanding of open source and get a taste of how developing is done in a professional setting. Mentorship is also something that contributes to my motivation for GSoC, it would be great to learn right from someone who has been a part of this field for so long.


### Why did you choose OWASP, and why this project idea?

During the orientation of the Coding Club of our college, they wanted to give us an introductory flavor of cybersecurity. For that purpose, OWASP Juice Shop was used to demonstrate SQL Injection. This is how I was exposed to OWASP. Since then, I have used different tools of OWASP while studying cybersecurity. If I can get a chance to contribute to OWASP, this is something I would not want to miss.

The reason for choosing BLT is simple - mobile development is my passion, and I am fluent in Flutter / Dart, which happens to be the stack of this project. I also have experience in working with Figma, and as this project requires some design work, it seems to be the best fit for me.

# Project Details


## Overview

My focus in the project is going to be the flutter app for BLT. The app lags behind the website by a huge margin. There’s only a little part of the backend that we can access with the app right now, whereas the website is filled with information. There are only a few ways users can interact with the app. The goal is to deliver an app that covers almost every piece of information stored in the backend so that there is no need to use the website on a mobile device. I am proposing a duration of **350 hours** for the following changes.


## Implementation

Let us now break down everything that will be delivered by the end



1. Fix the screen for company details.
2. Redesign the issue page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the issue.
3. Ability to surf profiles of other users.
4. Redesign the profile page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the user.
5. Use deep linking in order to open specific web URLs right into the app.
6. 404 Page for mobile.
7. Fix the report bug feature and add anonymous reporting.
8. Dark theme!
9. Cache network images locally.


## 1. Fix the screen for company details

We have a screen for company details (company_details.dart). The open and closed issues list are not functioning, and an error message is hard coded - 


### **Update GET /api/v1/domain/{id}**

The current response does not include the list of open and closed issues for the requested domain. I will overwrite the retrieve method of Domain viewset, to generate that list along with the other fields sent as a response in scoreboard.


### Update company_details.dart

Once the API is ready, I will update the CompanyDetailPage class to take a domain id as a parameter and will implement a FutureBuilder to fetch the data from the newly created API, and as a result, I will fix the open and closed issues list. This change will be helpful when we integrate deep linking in step 5.


## 2. Redesign the issue page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the issue

Right now the issue page doesn’t have much to offer. Information to include in the redesign which is not yet implemented -



* URL
* Number of views
* Bug type
* Domain
* Reporter
* Option to close the issue if user is the owner
* Option to see and add comments
* Option to bookmark the issue


### Update GET /api/v1/issues/{id}

The following changes need to be made -



* domain and user fields just have the id, instead, I will return the entire domain and user model in those fields so that information about them can be shown right on the issues page.
* New field - **comments** - I will filter all the objects of the Comment model to create a list of comments an issue has. On the generated list, I will add another filter to include only those comments which are not replies. This list will be shown on the issues detail page. Apart from this, for every comment in the final list, I will add another bool field hasChildren.


### Create GET /api/v1/replies/{id}

If a comment has hasChildren field true, we can pass its id to this api to get its immediate replies.


### Create POST /api/v1/issue/save/{id}

To save (bookmark) an issue. And toggle if already bookmarked.


### Create POST /api/v1/issue/close/{id}

To mark an issue as closed, accessible only to the owner of the issue.


### Create comment_replies.dart

This screen will take a comment id, and will populate its immediate replies using /api/v1/replies/{id}, each reply can have its own reply, for each the same screen will be used recursively.


### Update issue_detail.dart

This page will take an issue ID, instead of Issue model, and with the help of freshly made APIs, update the issue details page to show everything we have -



* Fetched Issue **URL**, number of **views** and **bug type** will be added directly to the UI
* For **domain**, we will show a card showing some information about the domain, it will be clickable to redirect the user to company details page, made in step 1.
* Add a button to add / remove the issue from **saved list**.
* If the **reporter** is the current user, show an option to close this issue. Clicking this will send a POST request to the API just created.
* At the very end of the page, a **list of comments** will be shown. For each comment, if its hasChildren field is true, a button to see its replies will be rendered. Clicking on that button will redirect to comment_replies.dart.
* For **reporter**, if the issue was not reported anonymously, we will have another card, showing some stats about the user, again it will be clickable to redirect to profile page of that user, which brings me to my next step.


![Issue Detail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37345795/223714293-0dc38cef-ea42-43c4-8d34-1e0d533567c8.png)


## 3. Ability to surf profiles of other users

As mentioned, right now user can only see their own profile. With this point, I aim to generalize the profile page to allow details of other users to be populated.


### Update GET /api/v1/profile/{id}

Right now this request only works if the user is requesting their own profile details. I will update this request to allow data to be fetched for others’ profiles as well. However the POST / PUT counterpart of this endpoint shall retain the restriction.


## 4. Redesign the profile page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the user

Just like the issue page, the profile page also shows limited information. The following changes will be made to show all the data neatly.


### Update GET /api/v1/profile/{id}

One more field will be added to list all the issues opened by the requested user. Another field having the list of users following the requested user.


### Create POST /api/v1/profile/follow/{id}

This will be used to follow a profile, and toggle if already followed.


### Update profile.dart

I will update this page to take a user ID, instead of user model, and fetch the details from /api/v1/profile/{id}. The following additionals will be made to the profile page -



* List of **opened issues** - another list will be shown consisting of issues opened by the user
* List of **following** - currently only the count of following is shown in the page, a list of the users will be shown, each of which will be clickable to open a new page with its details.
* List of followers - List of followers will be shown.
* Option to follow/unfollow - If the requested profile is not of the user, an option to follow/unfollow will be shown.

![User Profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37345795/223713910-601c2d64-39f4-4ea0-96dc-35273daf0fb1.png)


## 5. Use deep linking in order to open specific web URLs right into the app

Once we have all the above-mentioned information right in the app, I am going to use deep linking to open links like 



* [https://www.owasp.org/BLT/profile/letsintegreat/](https://www.owasp.org/BLT/profile/letsintegreat/)
* [https://www.owasp.org/BLT/issue/2087/](https://www.owasp.org/BLT/issue/2087/)
* [https://www.owasp.org/BLT/domain/bugheist.com/](https://www.owasp.org/BLT/domain/bugheist.com/)

in the app to show the requested information. If the user was logged in, they will also be able to interact with the pages, e.g. like a bug, follow a user. These links will also be launched in the app for non-logged-in users, but they won’t be able to interact until they log in. This feature will drastically improve UX for mobile users!


## 6. 404 Page for mobile.

As we are now opening links right in our app, it’s time to implement our cute 404 page whose design is waiting to be a part of the app for so long!


### Create page_404.dart

![ERROR PAGE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37345795/223713842-7c407e6f-1842-4a54-91ad-3f28e0b9c78c.png)


## 7. Fix the report bug feature and add anonymous reporting

Right now the report bug is broken in the mobile app. I aim to fix it and add an option for anonymous reporting. When the user is not logged in, the bug will automatically be reported anonymously.


### Update report_bug.dart

When the user is logged in, a checkbox will be shown to opt to report the bug anonymously, in that case, an anonymous user will be passed to the API.


## 8. Dark theme!

Isn’t this the most desired feature of any app?! Design the dark theme color scheme for the app, and implement a theme manager. Add an option to switch between themes, and store the last selected theme locally.


### Create theme_provider.dart

This will store ThemeData for light and dark modes, and also the ThemeMode. We will add these themes right to the MaterialApp.


## 9. Cache network images locally

On every reload of the app, almost all the previously shown images are supposed to be rendered again. It takes a lot of time to load all the resources. We can cache these resources locally and re use them. Load time will drop significantly and UX will be improved.


### Use cached_network_image package

[cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image/) is an amazing package to our aid!


## Availability

I will be available for approximately **30 hours per week** in the month of May, June, and July because of my semester break. Starting around 25th July, I will be able to do little work for 1-2 weeks because of my intern season tests and interviews. Post that I will again be available.


## Why me?

As I have already worked on a number of improvements for the BLT flutter app, I already know these waters well and it won’t be difficult for me to get familiar with the rest of the codebase. I have also worked on various flutter projects to gain enough experience to tackle any bottleneck I might face during the project. I also have amazing googling skills, which is undoubtedly the best weapon one can have in a battle of development. I am always ready to learn new tech if the need so be.


## After GSoC

Being an open source enthusiast, completion of GSoC is not going to stop me from contributing code to open source for the greater cause. In the span of three months, I will get to know the BLT project inside out and I would love to collaborate with others in ideating, and bringing new features to life. I would also love to guide newcomers in this field who might stumble upon this project to help them ease their journey of open source.
