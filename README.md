## About Me

Hey there, I am Harshit Seksaria. I am currently a sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati, pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering. I am an open-source enthusiast with a keen interest in development, specifically mobile development and sports programming.

I have always looked at the skill of development in a way that could create value for folk and drastically reduce manual work. This becomes evident in the projects I have worked on - (i) a portal for my college peers, to benchmark their academic performance and for self-assessment, which received more than 600 registrations, (ii) a discord bot for a competitive open-source event - Codepeak, which crawls the GitHub website to identify merged PRs and award points to the participants in a google spreadsheet. The impact of this bot was that it nullified the amount of manual work for mentors to maintain the spreadsheet after every contribution.


## Skills



* Well versed in Android Development - **Kotlin**, **Flutter**, and **Dart**.
* Fluent in the following backends - **Firebase**, **Django**, and **Appwrite**.
* Experienced with using **APIs**.
* Proficient in version control with **Git** & **GitHub** including actions/workflows.
* Experienced with **Python** for various domains like web scraping, automation, etc.
* Decent working experience in **Figma**.
* Proficient in Database Management using **SQL**.
* Proficient in **C** / **C++**.


## Open Source History

Being an open-source enthusiast, I have been following it, making regular contributions, and participating in various open-source events for a long time now. Following is the list of open-source events I have been a part of.


* **Google Code In 2018** - Participated and contributed to different projects, and successfully completed **4 tasks** during the event.
* **Codepeak 2021 (Participant)** - Codepeak is an annual month-long open source competition co-organized by IIT Guwahati and IIT Patna. Ranked **2nd** among 2500+ participants.
* **Hacktoberfest 2022** - Got **8 PRs merged** in projects tagged with hacktoberfest during the month-long event.
* **Codepeak 2022 (Mentor)** - Mentored for a project in the event.


## Statement of Motivation


### What is your motivation for participating in Google Summer of Code?

I have always been intrigued by how open source can turn an idea into a working entity that is used by hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. I myself have grown up consuming different open-source softwares. Even as a developer, a significant portion of the tech stacks I use consists of open source services. I firmly believe that open source is not getting the recognition it deserves. By participating in GSoC, I want to further hone my understanding of open source and get a taste of how developing is done in a professional setting. Mentorship is also something that contributes to my motivation for GSoC, it would be great to learn right from someone who has been a part of this field for so long.


### Why did you choose OWASP, and why this project idea?

During the orientation of the Coding Club of our college, they wanted to give us an introductory flavor of cybersecurity. For that purpose, OWASP Juice Shop was used to demonstrate SQL Injection. This is how I was exposed to OWASP. Since then, I have used different tools of OWASP while studying cybersecurity. If I can get a chance to contribute to OWASP, this is something I would not want to miss.

The reason for choosing BLT is simple - mobile development is my passion, and I am fluent in Flutter / Dart, which happens to be the stack of this project. I also have experience in working with Figma, and as this project requires some design work, it seems to be the best fit for me.

# Project Details


## Overview

My focus in the project is going to be the flutter app for BLT. The app lags behind the website by a huge margin. There’s only a little part of the backend that we can access with the app right now, whereas the website is filled with information. There are only a few ways users can interact with the app. The goal is to deliver an app that covers almost every piece of information stored in the backend so that there is no need to use the website on a mobile device. I am proposing a duration of **350 hours** for the following changes.


## Implementation

Let us now break down everything that will be delivered by the end



1. Fix the screen for company.
2. Redesign the issue page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the issue.
3. Ability to surf profiles of other users.
4. Redesign the profile page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the user.
5. Use deep linking in order open specific web URLs right into the app.
6. Fix the report bug feature and add anonymous reporting.
7. Dark theme!


### 1. Fix the screen for company

On the company’s screen, the list of open/closed issues has not yet implemented. Fetch the list from backend and show them on the screen.


### 2. Redesign the issue page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the issue

Right now the issue page doesn’t have much to offer. The information currently shown is -



* Creation date
* Status
* Screenshot
* Description

Information to include in the redesign -



* URL
* Views
* Bug type
* Domain
* Reporter
* Option to close the issue if user is the owner
* Option to see and add comments

Also, the domain and reporter will be clickable which will redirect to their respective pages. But right now, user can only see their own profile, which brings me to my next point.


### 3. Ability to surf profiles of other users

As mentioned, right now user can only see their own profile. With this point, I aim to generalize the profile page to allow details of other users to be populated.


### 4. Redesign the profile page in order to show every piece of information we have regarding the user

Just like the issue page, the profile page also shows limited information. Currently, it has -



* Name
* Description
* Count of following
* Score
* Liked Issues
* Flagged Issues

The information which I aim to show -



* Opened Issues
* List of following
* List of followers

Because now users can also surf others’ profiles, an option to follow will also be added.


### 5. Use deep linking in order open specific web URLs right into the app

Once we have all the above-mentioned information right in the app, I am going to use deep linking to open links like 



* [https://www.bugheist.com/profile/letsintegreat_/](https://www.bugheist.com/profile/letsintegreat_/)
* [https://www.bugheist.com/issue/2087/](https://www.bugheist.com/issue/2087/)
* [https://www.bugheist.com/domain/bugheist.com/](https://www.bugheist.com/domain/bugheist.com/)

in the app to show the requested information. If the user was logged in, they will also be able to interact with the pages, e.g. like a bug, follow a user. These links will also be launched in the app for not logged-in users, but they won’t be able to interact until they log in. This feature will drastically improve UX for mobile users!


### 6. Fix the report bug feature and add anonymous reporting

Right now the report bug is broken in the mobile app. I aim to fix it and add an option for anonymous reporting. When the user is not logged in, the bug will automatically be reported anonymously.


### 7. Dark theme!

Isn’t this the most desired feature of any app?! Design the dark theme color scheme for the app, and implement a theme manager. Add an option to switch between themes, and store the last selected theme locally.


## Availability

I will be available for approximately **30 hours per week** in the month of May, June, and July because of my semester break. Starting around 25th July, I will be able to do little work for 1-2 weeks because of my intern season tests and interviews. Post that I will again be available.


## Why me?

As I have already worked on a number of improvements for the BLT flutter app, I already know these waters well and it won’t be difficult for me to get familiar with the rest of the codebase. I have also worked on various flutter projects to gain enough experience to tackle any bottleneck I might face during the project. I also have amazing googling skills, which is undoubtedly the best weapon one can have in a battle of development. I am always ready to learn new tech if the need so be.


## After GSoC

Being an open source enthusiast, completion of GSoC is not going to stop me from contributing code to open source for the greater cause. In the span of three months, I will get to know the BLT project inside out and I would love to collaborate with others in ideating, and bringing new features to life. I would also love to guide newcomers in this field who might stumble upon this project to help them ease their journey of open source.
